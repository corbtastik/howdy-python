## Python example for CF

Simple python microservice that you can push to CF and feel good about life.

Example exposes 3 HTTP endpoints...  

For a random int:  
``/int``

For a random int with min and max values:  
``/int?min=10&max=100``

Howdy Boot, Howdy Kotlin, Howdy Nodejs and Howdy Python are all simple microservices that each expose a different random API implemented in a different language.  For example, Howdy Boot exposes a random name API, Howdy Kotlin exposes a random address API, Howdy Nodejs exposes enpoints to encrypt and decrypt text and Howdy Python exposes a random number API.  All examples that show the power of PCF to run microservices in a language-agnostic manner ( awe yeah).
